Conventional Committer
----------------------

This small script helps you to commit your current changes using conventional commits.

# Example

* Given you are on a branch with name `rickschubert/ABC-123/conventional-committer` where the ticket number is enclosed by two slashes

* And you execute the script with `go run main.go [changeType] rest of the message with spaces, however you want`

* Then we will run `git add -A` to add all files

* And we will create a commit with message `changeType(ABC-123): rest of the message with spaces, however you want`

# One-line usage from shell

If you want to be able to fire the script from anywhere in your terminal, like so `feat I just built a new feature`, make sure to set an alias in your shell configuration:

Set the following in your `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
# Custom conventional commiter
alias fix="go run /path/to/conventional-committer/main.go fix"
alias feat="go run /path/to/conventional-committer/main.go feat"
alias chore="go run /path/to/conventional-committer/main.go chore"
alias docs="go run /path/to/conventional-committer/main.go docs"
alias tests="go run /path/to/conventional-committer/main.go test"
```

Now you can for example run `feat I have created a new feature` and it will automatically create conventional commits for you!

Note: We have to use `tests` instead of `test` because `test` is a shell built-in command.
